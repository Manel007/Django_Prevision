                "Nitrogenous":"Nitrogenous soils are rich in nitrogen, an essential nutrient for plant growth. These soils support vigorous vegetative growth and are crucial for crop production.",
    "Chalky (Calcareous)": "This soil type has a higher pH and can be challenging for certain plants. Consider adding organic matter to improve nutrient retention.",
    "Sandy": "Sandy soil drains quickly but may require more frequent watering. It's ideal for plants that thrive in well-draining conditions.",
    "Clay": "Clay soil is dense and holds nutrients well but can be prone to waterlogging. Adding compost can help with aeration.",
    "Loamy": "Loamy soil is a balanced mix of sand, silt, and clay, making it ideal for most plants. It retains moisture and provides good drainage.",
    "Peaty": "Peaty soil is rich in organic matter and moisture, making it excellent for acid-loving plants. It can benefit from lime to reduce acidity.",
    "Saline": "Saline soil contains high levels of salts, which can be detrimental to most plants. Improving drainage and leaching salts with water can help.",
    "Silty": "Silty soil retains moisture and nutrients well, making it suitable for many crops. However, it can become compacted, so regular aeration is beneficial.",
    "Organic": "Organic soil is rich in decomposed plant and animal matter. It's highly fertile and excellent for gardening but can be prone to drainage issues.",
    "Rocky": "Rocky soil contains a significant amount of stones and boulders, making it challenging for root growth. Improving soil quality with organic matter can help.",
    "Brown": "Brown soil is usually rich in minerals and good for agriculture. It retains moisture well, but overuse can lead to depletion of nutrients.",
    "Black": "Black soil is rich in organic material and ideal for growing crops. It's known for its moisture retention and fertility.",
    "Red": "Red soil is rich in iron and typically found in tropical regions. It may require fertilization to enhance its nutrient content for optimal plant growth.",
    "Gray": "Gray soil often indicates poor drainage or high clay content. Amending it with organic material can improve its structure and nutrient availability.",
    "White": "White soil, often containing high calcium carbonate, may have drainage issues. Adding organic matter can help improve its structure.",
    "Loess": "Loess soil is a fertile, wind-blown silt that holds moisture well. It is great for crops but can erode easily if not managed properly.",
    "Muck": "Muck soil is very rich in organic material and retains water effectively. It is highly productive for farming but can become compacted.",
    "Gypsum": "Gypsum soil contains high levels of calcium sulfate and is often found in arid regions. It can improve soil structure and drainage when mixed with clay.",
    "Podzol": "Podzol soil is acidic and typically found in forested regions. It may require amendments to improve its fertility for agricultural use.",
    "Regosol": "Regosol is a young soil found in recently disturbed areas. It may lack nutrients but can be enriched with organic matter for better productivity.",
    "Terra Rossa": "Terra Rossa is a red soil rich in iron and often found in Mediterranean climates. It is well-drained and suitable for vine cultivation.",
    "Vertisol": "Vertisol is clay-rich soil known for its swelling and shrinking properties. It is highly fertile but can be difficult to manage due to its texture.",
    "Histosol": "Histosol is a soil type made up of organic materials and is typically found in wetlands. It is very fertile but can have drainage issues.",
    "Aridisol": "Aridisols are dry soils found in arid regions. They require careful management to support plant growth due to their low nutrient content.",
    "Andisol": "Andisol is a volcanic soil that is highly fertile and retains moisture well. It's ideal for a variety of crops but can be prone to erosion.",
    "Chernozem": "Chernozem is a rich, black soil known for its high organic matter content. It is found in grassland regions and is highly fertile for agriculture.",
    "Gelisol": "Gelisols are cold soils typically found in polar regions or high altitudes. They have a layer of permafrost and can be challenging for agriculture.",
    "Alfisols": "Alfisols are moderately fertile soils found in temperate regions. They have a clay-rich horizon and are good for agriculture with proper management.",
    "Ultisols": "Ultisols are weathered soils found in humid subtropical regions. They tend to be low in nutrients and require amendments for effective crop production.",
    "Spodosol": "Spodosols are acidic, sandy soils often found in coniferous forests. They can be nutrient-poor but may support certain types of vegetation.",
    "Inceptisol": "Inceptisols are young soils with some development but not yet fully matured. They can be found in diverse environments and may support various crops.",
    "Aquolls": "Aquolls are soils that have a significant amount of moisture and are typically found in wetland areas. They are very productive for certain crops.",
    "Oxisol": "Oxisols are highly weathered tropical soils known for their low nutrient content but can be very productive with proper management practices.",
    "Histosol": "Histosols are organic soils rich in decomposed plant material. They are very fertile but can have drainage issues and are usually found in wetland areas."
